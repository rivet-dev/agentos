//! Regression repro for "projected command packages resolve commands in the VM".
//!
//! A command package (e.g. `@agentos-software/coreutils`) must be projected into `/opt/agentos`
//! so the sidecar's command discovery can resolve guest commands. Before package projection was the
//! sole boot path, stale helpers could create a VM with no usable command package and
//! `exec("echo hello")` failed with `command not found on native sidecar path: echo hello`.
//!
//! This suite self-gates: it skips (returns early) when the sidecar binary is not built or when the
//! coreutils package artifacts are absent, so it stays honest in unbuilt trees. When both prerequisites
//! are present it asserts the real contract: `echo hello` exits 0 with stdout `hello`.
